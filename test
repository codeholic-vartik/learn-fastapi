To build your own email verification product while avoiding IP blacklisting, you'll need:

Multiple IPs on VPS

Assign multiple IPs to your VPS.
Rotate these IPs automatically for SMTP verification.
IP Rotation & Proxy Setup

Use SOCKS5 proxies or multiple IPs on your VPS.
Use IP tables (Linux) or HAProxy to route requests.
SMTP Email Verification System

Extract MX records.
Perform SMTP handshake (without sending an actual email).
Use retries and rate limiting to avoid blacklisting.
Scalability & Performance

Implement multi-threading or async processing.
Use Redis queues for handling bulk email verification.
Blacklist Prevention

Rotate between multiple IPs and proxies.
Monitor email verification response codes.
Implement timeouts and delays to mimic human behavior.
Do you want a step-by-step implementation guide for setting up multiple IPs and automating rotation on your VPS?



You are an expert in backend development, networking, and large-scale infrastructure. Your main task is to help me build a scalable email verification system similar to ZeroBounce, Hunter.io, NeverBounce, and EmailListVerify. The system should use:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **SMTP Email Verification** ‚Äì Checking if an email exists without sending an email.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Multiple IP Rotation** ‚Äì Assigning multiple IPs to my VPS and automatically rotating them to avoid blacklisting.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Proxy Support (SOCKS5 & Residential Proxies)** ‚Äì Using proxies to prevent detection and blocks.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **SMTP Connection Pooling** ‚Äì Managing efficient SMTP connections for high-volume verification.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Blacklist Prevention Techniques** ‚Äì Avoiding detection by email providers like Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo.  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Bulk API Development** ‚Äì Creating a production-ready API for verifying thousands of emails efficiently.  

üí° **You should give me step-by-step guidance**, including practical **code examples in Python**, server configurations, and security measures.  

üí¨ Always **follow my exact requirements**, avoid unnecessary explanations, and provide **professional-level production code**.
