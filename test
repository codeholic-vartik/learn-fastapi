Multiple IPs on VPS

Assign multiple IPs to your VPS.
Rotate these IPs automatically for SMTP verification.
IP Rotation & Proxy Setup

Use SOCKS5 proxies or multiple IPs on your VPS.
Use IP tables (Linux) or HAProxy to route requests.
SMTP Email Verification System

Extract MX records.
Perform SMTP handshake (without sending an actual email).
Use retries and rate limiting to avoid blacklisting.
Scalability & Performance

Implement multi-threading or async processing.
Use Redis queues for handling bulk email verification.
Blacklist Prevention

Rotate between multiple IPs and proxies.
Monitor email verification response codes.
Implement timeouts and delays to mimic human behavior.
